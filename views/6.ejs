                <h2>Spider's Nest</h2>
                <p>Unexpectedly your feet start to stick to the ground, and you realize it is covered in a tangle of white threads. 
                    As you look around you notice webs cover every available surface, draped from corners, blocking off whole sections. 
                    You do not see any creatures or movement but you swear you hear the chittering of chitin following you.</p>
